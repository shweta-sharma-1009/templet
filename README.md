Description -

HTML -
<link href="./style.css" rel="stylesheet">: This line connects the webpage to a separate file called "style.css." This file contains instructions for how the page should look, like colors, fonts, and spacing.

<div class="container">: This is like a box that holds other things on the webpage. It's used twice, so there are two boxes nested inside each other.

<div class="main">: This is another box inside the outer container. It's a special area for the main content of the page.

<img src="..." alt="img">: This adds an image to the page. The "src" is the web address of the image, and "alt" is a description in case the image can't be shown.

<div class="content">: This is a box where the text and button will go. It's inside the "main" box.

<h1>Certified Coffee Courses</h1>: This is a big heading that says "Certified Coffee Courses."

<p>Lorem ipsum...ullamco.!</p>: This is a paragraph of text that talks about coffee courses. It's like a short description.

CSS - 
1. Resetting Defaults:
The first part (* {...}) makes sure that nothing has extra spacing or padding, and everything is properly sized in a box.
2. Sizing the Page:
.container takes up the whole screen width and height, creating a frame for our content.
3. Creating Space:
.blank makes an empty space at the top, about 25% of the container's height.
4. Main Content Area:
.main holds the main part of the page (75% of the container's height) and has a bright yellow background.
5. Image on Top:
Inside .main, there's an image (about 30% wide and full height), positioned above the content. It's like a sticker on the content.
6. Content Box:
.content is a box next to the image. It's where the main text goes. It's about 40% wide and as tall as the main content. It's centered vertically.
7. Heading, Paragraph, and Span Text:
h1 is a big headline with a centered text, nice and bold.
p is a bit smaller text that's also centered.
span is smaller still, centered, and has some space at the bottom.
8. Link and Button:
a makes a link, and it's shown in black color.
button is a black box you can click. It's got some padding around the text, and when you hover over it, it gets a bit bolder.
9. Change for Small Screens:
If the screen is less than 700px wide, .main becomes a single column. The image doesn't float anymore, and it just takes up 40% of the container's height.
In a simple project, this code creates a welcome section on a webpage. It has a colored background with a picture, a message, and buttons. It's designed to look good on both big and small screens. Just plug in your own text and image to personalize it for your needs.
<span>Image from<a href="#">Freepik</a></span>: This is a small piece of text that says "Image from Freepik." The <a> tag creates a link, but here the link doesn't go anywhere since it has a "#" symbol.
<button>LEARN MORE</button>: This is a button that says "LEARN MORE." It's something people can click on.
So, when you put all these pieces together, you get a webpage with a title about coffee courses, a description, an image of coffee being poured, a "LEARN MORE" button, and some credits for the image source
